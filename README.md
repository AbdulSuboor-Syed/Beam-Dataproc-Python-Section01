## Project Focus:
 A big data final project to develop the Google Page Rank System using DataProc Python.
## About Page Rank:
PageRank (PR) is a Google Search algorithm that ranks websites in search engine results. Google says that: PageRank calculates a rough estimate of the importance of a website by counting the number and quality of links to that page. The basic premise is that more important websites are more likely to gain links from other sites.
